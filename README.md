- 👋  Hi, I’m @Lail
- 👀  I’m a Senior Front-end Engineer and sometimes Team Lead or Tech Manager... whatever the situation calls for
- 🛠️  Mostly like building web apps with nice UI and mentoring newer devs
- 🧑‍🍳  I've always got some kinda of side-project cooking. If you ask me about it, I will gladly talk about it for too long
