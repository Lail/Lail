- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @Lail
- ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m a Senior Front-end Engineer and sometimes Team Lead or Tech Manager... whatever the situation calls for
- Mostly like building web apps with nice UI and mentoring newer devs
- I've always got some kinda of side-project cooking. If you ask me about it, I will gladly talk about it for too long
